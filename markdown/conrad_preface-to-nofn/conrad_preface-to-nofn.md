<!-- pb n='11' -->A work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art 
should carry its justification in every line. And art itself 
may be defined as a single-minded attempt to render the 
highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by bringing to 
light the truth, manifold and one, underlying its every aspect. 
It is an attempt to find in its forms, in its colours, in its light, 
in its shadows, in the aspects of matter and in the facts of 
life what of each is fundamental, what is enduring and essential---their 
one illuminating and convincing quality---the 
very truth of their existence. The artist, then, like the thinker 
or the scientist, seeks the truth and makes his appeal. Impressed 
by the aspect of the world the thinker plunges into 
ideas, the scientist into facts---whence, presently, emerging 
they make their appeal to those qualities of our being that fit 
us best for the hazardous enterprise of living. They speak 
authoritatively to our common-sense, to our intelligence, to 
our desire of peace or to our desire of unrest; not seldom to 
our prejudices, sometimes to our fears, often to our egoism---but 
always to our credulity. And their words are heard with 
reverence, for their concern is with weighty matters: with 
<!-- pb n='12' -->the cultivation of our minds and the proper care of our bodies, 
with the attainment of our ambitions, with the perfection of 
the means and the glorification of our precious aims.
 
It is otherwise with the artist.
 
Confronted by the same enigmatical spectacle the artist 
descends within himself, and in that lonely region of stress 
and strife, if he be deserving and fortunate, he finds the 
terms of his appeal. His appeal is made to our less obvious 
capacities: to that part of our nature which, because of the 
warlike conditions of existence, is necessarily kept out of 
sight within the more resisting and hard qualities---like the 
vulnerable body within a steel armour. His appeal is less 
loud, more profound, less distinct, more stirring---and sooner 
forgotten. Yet its effect endures forever. The changing wisdom 
of successive generations discards ideas, questions facts, 
demolishes theories. But the artist appeals to that part of our 
being which is not dependent on wisdom: to that in us which 
is a gift and not an acquisition---and, therefore, more permanently enduring. He speaks to our capacity for delight and 
wonder, to the sense of mystery surrounding our lives, to our 
sense of pity, and beauty, and pain; to the latent feeling of 
fellowship with all creation---and to the subtle but invincible 
conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of 
innumerable hearts, to the solidarity in dreams, in joy, in 
sorrow, in aspirations, in illusions, in hope, in fear, which 
binds men to each other, which binds together all humanity---the 
dead to the living and the living to the unborn.
 
It is only some such train of thought, or rather of feeling, 
that can in a measure explain the aim of the attempt, made 
in the tale which follows, to present an unrestful episode in 
the obscure lives of a few individuals out of all the disregarded 
<!-- pb n='13' -->multitude of the bewildered, the simple and the voiceless. For, if any part of truth dwells in the belief confessed 
above, it becomes evident that there is not a place of 
splendour or a dark corner of the earth that does not deserve, 
if only a passing glance of wonder and pity. The motive then, 
may be held to justify the matter of the work; but this preface, 
which is simply an avowal of endeavour, cannot end here---for 
the avowal is not yet complete.
 
Fiction---if it at all aspires to be art---appeals to temperament. 
And in truth it must be, like painting, like music, like 
all art, the appeal of one temperament to all the other innumerable 
temperaments whose subtle and resistless power 
endows passing events with their true meaning, and creates 
the moral, the emotional atmosphere of the place and time. 
Such an appeal to be effective must be an impression conveyed 
through the senses; and, in fact, it cannot be made in 
any other way, because temperament, whether individual or 
collective, is not amenable to persuasion. All art, therefore, 
appeals primarily to the senses, and the artistic aim when 
expressing itself in written words must also make its appeal 
through the senses, if its high desire is to reach the secret 
spring of responsive emotions. It must strenuously aspire to 
the plasticity of sculpture, to the colour of painting, and to 
the magic suggestiveness of music---which is the art of arts. 
And it is only through complete, unswerving devotion to the 
perfect blending of form and substance; it is only through an 
unremitting never-discouraged care for the shape and ring of 
sentences that an approach can be made to plasticity, to 
colour, and that the light of magic suggestiveness may be 
brought to play for an evanescent instant over the commonplace 
<!-- pb n='14' -->surface of words: of the old, old words, worn thin, defaced 
by ages of careless usage.
 
The sincere endeavour to accomplish that creative task, 
to go as far on that road as his strength will carry him, to go 
undeterred by faltering, weariness or reproach, is the only 
valid justification for the worker in prose. And if his conscience 
is clear, his answer to those who in the fulness of a 
wisdom which looks for immediate profit, demand specifically 
to be edified, consoled, amused; who demand to be promptly 
improved, or encouraged, or frightened, or shocked, or 
charmed, must run thus:---My task which I am trying to 
achieve is, by the power of the written word to make you 
hear, to make you feel---it is, before all, to make you *see*. 
That---and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you 
shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, 
consolation, fear, charm---all you demand---and, perhaps, also 
that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.
 
To snatch in a moment of courage, from the remorseless 
rush of time, a passing phase of life, is only the beginning of 
the task. The task approached in tenderness and faith is to 
hold up unquestioningly, without choice and without fear, 
the rescued fragment before all eyes in the light of a sincere 
mood. It is to show its vibration, its colour, its form; and 
through its movement, its form, and its colour, reveal the 
substance of its truth---disclose its inspiring secret: the stress 
and passion within the core of each convincing moment. In 
a single-minded attempt of that kind, if one be deserving and 
fortunate, one may perchance attain to such clearness of 
sincerity that at last the presented vision of regret or pity, of 
terror or mirth, shall awaken in the hearts of the beholders 
that feeling of unavoidable solidarity; of the solidarity in 
<!-- pb n='15' -->mysterious origin, in toil, in joy, in hope, in uncertain fate, 
which binds men to each other and all mankind to the visible 
world.
 
It is evident that he who, rightly or wrongly, holds by the 
convictions expressed above cannot be faithful to any one of 
the temporary formulas of his craft. The enduring part of 
them---the truth which each only imperfectly veils---should 
abide with him as the most precious of his possessions, but 
they all: Realism, Romanticism, Naturalism, even the unofficial 
sentimentalism (which like the poor, is exceedingly 
difficult to get rid of), all these gods must, after a short period 
of fellowship, abandon him---even on the very threshold of the 
temple---to the stammerings of his conscience and to the outspoken 
consciousness of the difficulties of his work. In that 
uneasy solitude the supreme cry of Art for Art itself, loses the 
exciting ring of its apparent immorality. It sounds far off. It 
has ceased to be a cry, and is heard only as a whisper, often 
incomprehensible, but at times and faintly encouraging.
 
Sometimes, stretched at ease in the shade of a roadside tree, 
we watch the motions of a labourer in a distant field, and after 
a time, begin to wonder languidly as to what the fellow may 
be at. We watch the movements of his body, the waving of his 
arms, we see him bend down, stand up, hesitate, begin again. 
It may add to the charm of an idle hour to be told the purpose 
of his exertions. If we know he is trying to lift a stone, to dig 
a ditch, to uproot a stump, we look with a more real interest 
at his efforts; we are disposed to condone the jar of his agitation 
upon the restfulness of the landscape; and even, if in a 
brotherly frame of mind, we may bring ourselves to forgive 
his failure. We understood his object, and, after all, the fellow 
<!-- pb n='16' -->has tried, and perhaps he had not the strength---and perhaps 
he had not the knowledge. We forgive, go on our way---and 
forget.
 
And so it is with the workman of art. Art is long and life is 
short, and success is very far off. And thus, doubtful of 
strength to travel so far, we talk a little about the aim---the 
aim of art, which, like life itself, is inspiring, difficult---obscured 
by mists. It is not in the clear logic of a triumphant 
conclusion; it is not in the unveiling of one of those heartless 
secrets which are called the Laws of Nature. It is not less 
great, but only more difficult.
 
To arrest, for the space of a breath, the hands busy about 
the work of the earth, and compel men entranced by the sight 
of distant goals to glance for a moment at the surrounding 
vision of form and color, of sunshine and shadows; to make 
them pause for a look, for a sigh, for a smile---such is the aim, 
difficult and evanescent, and reserved only for a few to 
achieve. But sometimes, by the deserving and the fortunate, 
even that task is accomplished. And when it is accomplished---behold!---all 
the truth of life is there: a moment of vision, a 
sigh, a smile---and the return to an eternal rest.

To regard all things and principles of things as 
inconstant modes or fashions has more and more 
become the tendency of modern thought. Let us 
begin with that which is without---our physical life. 
Fix upon it in one of its more exquisite intervals, 
the moment, for instance, of delicious recoil from 
the flood of water in summer heat. What is the 
whole physical life in that moment but a combination 
of natural elements to which science gives 
their names? But these elements, phosphorus and 
lime and delicate fibres, are present not in the 
human body alone: we detect them in places most 
remote from it. Our physical life is a perpetual 
motion of them---the passage of the blood, the 
wasting and repairing of the lenses of the eye, the 
modification of the tissues of the brain by every ray 
of light and sound---processes which science reduces 
to simpler and more elementary forces. Like the 
<!-- pb n='208' -->elements of which we are composed, the action of 
these forces extends beyond us; it rusts iron and 
ripens corn. Far out on every side of us those elements 
are broadcast, driven by many forces; and birth 
and gesture and death and the springing of violets 
from the grave are but a few out of ten thousand 
resulting combinations. That clear perpetual outline 
of face and limb is but an image of ours under 
which we group them---a design in a web, the actual 
threads of which pass out beyond it. This at least 
of flame-like our life has, that it is but the concurrence, 
renewed from moment to moment, of forces 
parting sooner or later on their ways.

Or if we begin with the inward world of thought 
and feeling, the whirlpool is still more rapid, the 
flame more eager and devouring. There it is no 
longer the gradual darkening of the eye and fading 
of colour from the wall,---the movement of the shore 
side, where the water flows down indeed, though in 
apparent rest,---but the race of the midstream, a drift 
of momentary acts of sight and passion and thought. 
At first sight experience seems to bury us under a 
flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a 
sharp importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves 
in a thousand forms of action. But when 
reflection begins to act upon those objects they are 
dissipated under its influence; the cohesive force is 
<!-- pb n='209' -->suspended like a trick of magic; each object is loosed 
into a group of impressions---colour, odour, texture---in 
the mind of the observer. And if we continue 
to dwell on this world, not of objects in the solidity 
with which language invests them, but of impressions 
unstable, flickering, inconsistent, which burn and 
are extinguished with our consciousness of them, it 
contracts still further; the whole scope of observation 
is dwarfed to the narrow chamber of the individual 
mind. Experience, already reduced to a swarm of 
impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that 
thick wall of personality through which no real voice 
has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that 
which we can only conjecture to be without. Every 
one of those impressions is the impression of the 
individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a 
solitary prisoner its own dream of a world. 

Analysis goes a step farther still, and tells us that 
those impressions of the individual to which, for 
each one of us, experience dwindles down, are in 
perpetual flight; that each of them is limited by 
time, and that as time is infinitely divisible, each 
of them is infinitely divisible also; all that is 
actual in it being a single moment, gone while we 
try to apprehend it, of which it may ever be more 
truly said that it has ceased to be than that it 
is. To such a tremulous wisp constantly reforming 
<!-- pb n='210' -->itself on the stream, to a single sharp impression, 
with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, 
of such moments gone by, what is *real* in our life 
fines itself down. It is with the movement, the 
passage and dissolution of impressions, images, 
sensations, that analysis leaves off,---that continual 
vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving 
and unweaving of ourselves.

*Philosophiren*, says Novalis, *ist dephlegmatisiren 
vivificiren*. The service of philosophy, of religion 
and culture as well, to the human spirit, is 
to startle it into a sharp and eager observation. 
Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or 
face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than 
the rest; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual 
excitement is irresistibly real and attractive 
for us,---for that moment only. Not the fruit of 
experience, but experience itself is the end. A 
counted number of pulses only is given to us of 
a variegated, dramatic life. How may we see in 
them all that is to be seen in them by the finest 
senses? How can we pass most swiftly from point 
to point, and be present always at the focus where 
the greatest number of vital forces unite in their 
purest energy?

To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, 
to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life. Failure 
<!-- pb n='211' -->is to form habits: for habit is relative to a stereotyped 
world; meantime it is only the roughness 
of the eye that makes any two persons, things, 
situations, seem alike. While all melts under our 
feet, we may well catch at any exquisite passion, 
or any contribution to knowledge that seems, by a 
lifted horizon, to set the spirit free for a moment, 
or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange 
flowers, and curious odours, or work of the artist's 
hands, or the face of one's friend. Not to discriminate 
every moment some passionate attitude in 
those about us, and in the brilliance of their gifts 
some tragic dividing of forces on their ways is, on 
this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before 
evening. With this sense of the splendour of our 
experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all 
we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, 
we shall hardly have time to make theories about 
the things we see and touch. What we have to 
do is to be for ever curiously testing new opinions 
and courting new impressions, never acquiescing in 
a facile orthodoxy of Comte or of Hegel, or of our 
own. Theories, religious or philosophical ideas, as 
points of view, instruments of criticism, may help 
us to gather up what might otherwise pass unregarded 
by us. *La philosophie, c'est la microscope 
de la pensée*. The theory, or idea, or system, which 
<!-- pb n='212' -->requires of us the sacrifice of any part of this experience, 
in consideration of some interest into which 
we cannot enter, or some abstract morality we have 
not identified with ourselves, or what is only conventional, 
has no real claim upon us.

One of the most beautiful places in the writings 
of Rousseau is that in the sixth book of the 'Confessions,' 
where he describes the awakening in him of 
the literary sense. An undefinable taint of death 
had always clung about him, and now in early manhood 
he believed himself stricken by mortal disease. 
He asked himself how he might make as much as 
possible of the interval that remained; and he was 
not biassed by anything in his previous life when 
he decided that it must be by intellectual excitement, 
which he found in the clear, fresh writings 
of Voltaire. Well, we are all *condamnés*, as Victor 
Hugo says: *les hommes sont tous condamnés a morte 
avec des sursis indéfinis*: we have an interval, and 
then our place knows us no more. Some spend this 
interval in listlessness, some in high passions, the 
wisest in art and song. For our one chance is in expanding 
that interval, in getting as many pulsations 
as possible into the given time. High passions give 
one this quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow 
of love, political or religious enthusiasm, or the 
'enthusiasm of humanity.' Only, be sure it is 
<!-- pb n='213' -->passion, that it does yield you this fruit of a 
quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of this wisdom, 
the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the 
love of art for art's sake has most; for art comes 
to you professing frankly to give nothing but 
the highest quality to your moments as they 
pass, and simply for those moments' sake.
